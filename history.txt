# Project Goals

- Create a personal website and blog for professional exposure.
- Use Flask for the backend, and Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for the frontend.

# Project History

- **Initial Setup:**
  - Initialized a new Flask project.
  - Set up Python dependency management using `pyproject.toml` and added `Flask` and `python-dotenv`.
  - Configured the project for editable installation with `pip install -e .`.
  - Set up the frontend toolchain using npm, creating a `package.json` file.
  - Added frontend dependencies: `tailwindcss`, `daisyui`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer`.

- **File Structure:**
  - Created the main Flask application file: `app.py`.
  - Created the directory structure for `static` files and `templates`.
  - Added the input stylesheet for Tailwind: `static/css/input.css`.
  - Created a base HTML template (`templates/base.html`) and a home page template (`templates/index.html`).

- **Configuration:**
  - Configured `tailwind.config.js` to process the template files and enable the DaisyUI plugin.
  - Configured `postcss.config.js` to use `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer`.
  - Added an npm script (`build:css`) to compile the CSS.
  - Added a `dev` script to `package.json` using `concurrently` to run the CSS compiler and Flask server together.

- **UI and Routing:**
  - Added a navigation bar to the base template with links to "About" and "Blog".
  - Updated the base template to center the page content.
  - Set the "About" page as the default index route.
  - Created placeholder pages for "About" and "Blog".
