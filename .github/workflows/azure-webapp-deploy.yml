# Notes:
# 1) Create an Azure Web App (Linux) and grab its Publish Profile from the Azure Portal
#    (Overview -> Get publish profile). Add the file contents as the repository secret
#    `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` in GitHub (Settings -> Secrets -> Actions).
# 2) Replace `YOUR_APP_NAME` above with the name of the Web App resource.
# 3) This workflow expects `requirements.txt` to exist (we generated one) and a
#    Procfile/startup command is used by Azure. If you prefer Azure CLI deployment,
#    we can scaffold that instead.
